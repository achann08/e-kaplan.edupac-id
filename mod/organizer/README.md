Description
-----------

The organizer enables students to register for appointments, which can be created by teachers.


Usage
-------

Create appointments for group submission meetings for project work so that students can register independently for a desired appointment. For example, the appointments should be set up for 15 minutes each on Tuesday to Thursday between 8:00 and 12:00 over the next two weeks. Registration, deregistration and re-registration should be possible up to 2 days before the respective appointment. Student attendance and assessments should be documented.


Installation
------------

* Copy the code directly to the mod/organizer directory.

* Log into Moodle as administrator.

* Open the administration area (http://your-moodle-site/admin) to start the installation automatically.


Privacy API
--------------

The plugin fully implements the Moodle Privacy API.

Bug Reports / Support
---------------------

We try our best to deliver bug-free plugins, but we can not test the plugin for every platform,
database, PHP and Moodle version. If you find any bug please report it on
[GitHub](<https://github.com/academic-moodle-cooperation/moodle-mod_organizer/issues). Please
provide a detailed bug description, including the plugin and Moodle version and, if applicable, a
screenshot.

You may also file a request for enhancement on GitHub. If we consider the request generally useful
and if it can be implemented with reasonable effort we might implement it in a future version.

You may also post general questions on the plugin on GitHub, but note that we do not have the
resources to provide detailed support.
